# Logging In To Your Site

There are 2 ways to login to your website.

## Simple Way

If you scroll to the bottom of your website there is an admin link that will take you to the login screen. Once you're at the login screen put in your username and password as provided by Giant and hit the blue login button.

## Alternate Way

You can add /wp-admin to the end of your website URL and this will take you to the login screen. An example of this would be https://giantmedia.com.au/wp-admin
