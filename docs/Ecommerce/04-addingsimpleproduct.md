# Adding a Simple Product

A simple product is a product that doesn’t have variations e.g. different colors or sizes. To add a new product click on the products tab. Adding a Simple product is similar to writing a post in WordPress.

The inventory section allows you to manage stock for the product individually and define whether to allow backorders and more. It enables you to sell products and allows customers to add them to the cart to buy.

- Select whether to **Allow Backorders**.
- **Low stock threshold** – Enter a number upon which you are notified.
