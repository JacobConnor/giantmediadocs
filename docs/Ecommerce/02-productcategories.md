# Product Categories

Product categories are the primary way to group products with similar features. You can also add subcategories if desired.

For example, if you sell clothing, you might have “t-shirts”, “hoodies” and “pants” as categories.

## Creating A Category

Categories are managed from the **Products > Categories** screen.
Similar to categories on your posts in WordPress, you can add, delete, and edit product categories.

- Add a Name.
- Add a Slug (optional); this is the URL-friendly version of the name.
- Choose a Parent if this is a subcategory.
- Enter a Description (optional); some websites display this.
- Upload/Add Image (optional);  Some websites have pages where product category images are displayed, so this is a good idea.

Categories can also be reordered by dragging and dropping – this order is used by default on the front end whenever the categories are listed.

When you add a new product via **Products > Add Product**, you can select this new product category from the list.

Alternatively, you can go to **Products > Add Product** directly, and select **Add New Product Category**.
