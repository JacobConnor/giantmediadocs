# Introduction

Before adding your first product, let’s get familiar with how product categories, tags, and attributes work. Along with the different product types.

## Product Types

- **Simple** – covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are shipped and have no options. For example, a book.

- **Variable** – a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a t-shirt available in different colors and/or sizes.

## Product Categories

[Product Categories](../ecommerce/productcategories) and tags work in much the same way as normal categories and tags you have when writing posts in WordPress. They can be created, edited, and selected at any time. This can be done when you first create a product or come back and edit it or the category/tag specifically.

## Attributes

These can be added per product, or you can set up global attributes for the entire store to use (e.g., in layered navigation).
