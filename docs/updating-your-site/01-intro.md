# Introduction

It is important to keep your website up to date this will ensure your website is secure and running optimally. There are 2 main things that you need to keep up to date WordPress itself and plugins. This doesnâ€™t have to be every day but we do suggest every few weeks just check if there are any updates. We recommend updating things plugins 1 by 1 only because while highly unlikely this can break your website, this way you will be able to let us know what you were updating so we can get the website up and running for you asap.
